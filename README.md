# Pokémon Teambuilder (Rebuild – 2025)

A complete redesign and rebuild of my competitive Pokémon teambuilder mobile application, focused on flexibility, performance, and usability. This repo documents the process and implementation of the new system from the ground up.

---

## Overview

This mobile app helps competitive Pokémon players create, evaluate, and manage teams. It allows users to:

- Browse Pokémon and filter by typing, abilities, or roles
- Build and save competitive teams with full move/item/stat sets
- View coverage, resource, and stat charts
- Perform damage calculations with a damage calculator

---

## Rebuild Goals

This version is a **complete overhaul** of my original app, with goals including:

- **Modern architecture** (MVVM or similar)
- **Modular data and UI layers**
- **Dynamic support for new formats and mechanics** (e.g. Terastallization, Dynamax, Mega Evolution, etc.)
- **Better team analysis and visualization**
- **Improved search, filtering, and usability**
- **Optional account system to sync teams across devices**
