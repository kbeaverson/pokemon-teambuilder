# 2025-08-12 - Models

## Realtime Notes
- Removed UUID from Nature as it can readily be implemented as an enum and won't be stored in the database
- Refactoring the move fields for slots to be a json list of move_id/index pairs to allow for flexibility in the number of possible moves for a pokemon
- Refactoring ev/iv fields for slots in db to be json list of stat/int pairs, similar treatment for Pokemon base stats
- Slot, required override of toString/==/hashCode
- Too tired, will clean up daily log in the morning
