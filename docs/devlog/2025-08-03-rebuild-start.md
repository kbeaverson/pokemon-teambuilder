# 2025-08-03 – Rebuild Start: Goals, Vision, and Setup

## Motivation for the rebuild
I initially developed my pokemon teambuilding app out of a combination of love for the competitive pokemon scene, desire for a better teambuilding application, and a drive to create something with my newly developing coding skills. My efforts were meaningfully limited by my experience at that time, and so this project will be done justice with a rebuild utilizing all that I've learned since then. I aim to implement best practices for software architecture, state management, and mobile development. I've elected to pursue the rebuild route rather than a touch-up because, well, one look at my original project will quickly reveal how monstrous of a task that would be. 

## Goals of the Rebuild

- Start fresh with a structured development plan, applying modern best practices and design principles I’ve learned since my initial attempt.
- Implement a clean MVVM architecture to ensure proper separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. This goal addresses one of the major architectural gaps from my original build (which, to be fair, was begun after only my second coding class).
- Introduce online functionality, including user authentication and persistent accounts, to enable team syncing across devices.
- Deliver a complete and functional MVP within one month.
- Thoroughly document the entire rebuild process so that others may follow or learn from my efforts.

## Initial Structure

- `docs/ood_process/`: Documents the initial development stages
- `app/`: Stores the codebase for the app (currently a default flutter app)
- `docs/devlog`: Documents my development process/progress as I go 

## Setup

- Created new GitHub repository
- Initialized new flutter app in app directory
- Updated flutter to 3.32.8 from 3.27.3
