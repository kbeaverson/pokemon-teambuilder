# Devlog – Pokémon Teambuilder Rebuild (2025)

Welcome to the development log for the complete rebuild of my Pokémon Teambuilder app. This document will serve as a high-level overview, with links to regular entries found in `/docs/devlog/`.

## Purpose
To document architecture decisions, trade-offs, ideas, and roadblocks during the rebuild so others can understand my thinking, process, and approach.
